# Analysis of Execution Time for `find_min_max` Function

## Key Observations:
1. The function `find_min_max` employs a **divide-and-conquer approach** to determine the minimum and maximum values in an array.
2. The measured execution times were collected for arrays ranging in size from 1,000 to 100,000 elements.

## Performance Characteristics:
1. **Complexity**:
   - The algorithm exhibits a computational complexity of **O(n)**. This is because the divide-and-conquer approach splits the array recursively and performs constant-time comparisons at each step, effectively processing all elements in linear time.

2. **Execution Time vs Array Length**:
   - The relationship between execution time and array length is approximately linear, as indicated by the fitted line in the execution time plot.

3. **Empirical Results**:
   - Execution times grow proportionally with array length, consistent with the expected **O(n)** complexity.
   - For instance:
     - At 10,000 elements, the execution time is approximately 0.01 seconds.
     - At 50,000 elements, the execution time is approximately 0.05 seconds.
## Visualization:
The results are visualized in the plot "Execution Time vs Array Length". The scatter plot shows measured times, while the red line represents the fitted linear trend.

## Conclusion:
The `find_min_max` function demonstrates excellent scalability and adheres to its theoretical **O(n)** complexity. This makes it suitable for large datasets, as it processes arrays efficiently with minimal overhead.
